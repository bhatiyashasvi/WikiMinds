But as this intimate film reveals, his work is suffused with the trauma of migration, and the struggle to recognise himself as a ‘new Australian'. In conversation with documentarian Steven McIntyre, Dirk guides us through more than 40 years of his filmmaking: the early years exploring technique and technology, a subsequent phase of unflinching self-examination brought on by upheaval and overseas travel, and more recent projects where he attempts a fusion of personal, cultural, and historical identity. What emerges is an inspiring, rugged, and at times poignant portrait of an artist committed to self-expression and self-discovery through the medium of film.",The first retrospective examination of filmmaker Dirk de Bruyn's prolific and prodigious career.,Documentary,"biography, historical, avant-garde"

The suicide, exposed to a wide television audience, becomes a kind of sex act that plays upon the tension created between exhibitionist and voyeur. It forces viewers to take either an empathetic position vis-a-vis the exhibitionist, or to act as voyeurs (who release their repressed desire to see the forbidden face of Death). My interest is to understand the power seated in the position of the exhibitionist, and to explore that source of power for my own personal drama. Bud Dwyer gained power by authoring his own death, but his power was fatal: the instant power is taken via exhibitionism, it is lost through death. This is the traditional power for women who must seek power via exhibitionism and exploitation — they gain power only through death-of-self.""",,Documentary,

"Rain, Drizzle, and Fog",1998-01-01,"St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, is North America's most easterly landfall. For half a millennium, its perfect harbour has provided a safe refuge in the middle of the treacherous North Atlantic.

But people stayed, despite the colonial masters, despite the lack of law and order, despite hellish weather and raging seas. And the city grew--lurching through centuries of crisis, disaster, privation. For filmmaker Rosemary House, ""This is still a hard rock land, a dirty old town at the back of beyond. And yet the St. John's townie is so proud, you'd swear we lived in Paris."" In this documentary, she explores her city with the help of six locals, Mary Walsh, Andy Jones, Anita Best, Brian Hennessey, Ed Riche, Des Walsh, writers and performers all.

Everything works at the highest pitch of intensity and the orchestra sticks to his beat like glue. It's a necessary compensation for the shortcomings of the staging: the stolid chorus remains unperturbed by the storm and is directed to perform with unison movements; the acting (apart from Valeri Alexejev) is non-committal, and Alexandre Tarta's video direction somewhat flat-footed.

Phantom Limb reminds viewers that while grief is painful and isolating, it is a reminder to each of us that life is impermanent. - Jay Rosenblatt",,Documentary,

I believe the footage was completed before the assassination of Kennedy – an event that changed many things. I had made only silent films until I made THE ELMS, which followed upon this one. SSP is a film whose form I had in mind from the outset. It was to be a visual piece structured in a 'musical' manner. It would have three movements in differing visual 'tempi'. Rhythms, counterpoint, theme and variation, and so on were to be in mind as I filmed and edited. The thematic material would develop slowly, and there would be recapitulations and so on. The three sections are entitled 'Barn', 'Summer Storm', and 'Bird'.  A sense of place, shelter, and fertility. A welcoming of the necessary summer storm of birthing.

From the beginning of the 20th century with Charlie Chaplin, to the present day with James Thierrée, his grandson, this archival film relates the evolution of clowns across the world, identifies affinities and marks breaking points. The whole range of the art of the clown is represented, from Popov’s and Slava’s obsession with perfection, to Fratellini’s or Semianyki’s clumsiness as art. A saga like a wild poetic gospel, which showcases their humorous dimension but also underscores their tragic aspect. With complex characters such as Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati, who make us shiver by the accuracy of their take on the human condition and remind us, with Fellini, that clowns don the ridiculousness of mankind.",,,clown

Mark of the Hand,1987-01-01,"Guyanese painter Aubrey Williams (1926-1990) returns to his homeland on a “journey to the source of his inspiration” in this vivid Arts Council documentary, filmed towards the end of his life.

Timehri was also then the name of the international airport at Georgetown, Guyana's capital, where Williams stops off to restore an earlier mural.  The film offers a rare insight into life beyond Georgetown, what Williams calls “the real Guyana.” Before moving to England in 1952 he had been sent to work on a sugar plantation in the jungle; this is his first chance to revisit the region and the Warao Indians - formative influences on his work - in four decades. Challenging the ill-treatment of indigenous Guyanese, Williams explored the potential of art to change attitudes.

This film is inspired by the Native American dance performed especially in the 1890s to encourage renewal and prosperity – or from another point of view, to drive out the white man and bring back the buffalo. This is a meditative landscape piece, set between a eulogy for an unspoken past and a plea for attention to an unmapped future …  Music is an original work called LENS, written and performed by composer/ cellist Ha-Yang Kim."" - Holly Fisher",,,

Journey West: Buwarrala Aryah,2019-01-01,"Growing concern among young Aboriginal community leaders, particularly those in the Borroloola Men's Group, drew them to the idea of re-enacting a walk that hadn't occurred for almost thirty years.

The Martyr,1975-01-01,"""Let us suppose that the human condition can be pictured as a ferris wheel standing at the North Pole. This ferries wheel contains nine seats. They are labeled such: Lower Class, Middle Class, Upper Class, Jealousy, Ambition, Greed, Sadism, Masochism, and Religion [...] Where one gets on is simply a freak accident. It really makes no difference – all the seats are connected and bolted to the wheel by Choice and Acceptance. So in other words, one may board the wheel on the Lower Class seat and choose to move ahead to the Middle or Upper Class seats [...] Advancement is usually a long, hard process that throws many people from their seats for the benefit of one. Is such a profit worth it? What has been gained other than a sick, tired old body, free of friends and fun? Capital gain! Position! [...] The wheel turns round and round and so does the scramble. The last seat may be full of riders, but hell if they have anything to ride on."" – Richard G. Merciez, 1975",,,

Crunch: Super SlimDown - Yoga/Pilates Blend,2006-02-07,"So here's a portrait of yoga in the 21st Century: this ancient discipline, created thousands of years ago to enhance the meditative experience (the asanas or poses commonly used in hatha yoga were in fact designed to enable meditators to sit quietly, calmly and comfortably for hours on end), is now ""a total body blast,"" with users urged to ""get hard core"" and ""feel the groove,"" all so ""your torso will look buff."" At least that's how Ellen Barrett, the relentlessly sunny instructor featured in Crunch Yoga's Super SlimDown: Pilates Yoga Blend, sees it. But while that approach may sound pretty frightening to traditionalists, this can't in fairness be viewed as a typical yoga video; nor does Barrett, who commingles power yoga moves and what she describes as ""core-conditioning power pilates,"" make any claims that it is. Many of the poses--including Warrior II, extended right angle, cobra, locust, and others--will certainly be familiar to yogis.",,Documentary,"dance, workout, fitness, dance workout"

His surviving works are also deeply enigmatic, highly symbolic images filled with the spirit of the Middle Ages. But the appeal of Bosch's work has long outlasted the late medieval age in which he lived. Though his art addressed the human follies of his own time, the satirical humor that he used can still be readily appreciated today. His intensely spiritual images of Christ and the Saints also continue to inspire many modern students, but it is Bosch's remarkable visions of the fantastic that are, undoubtedly, his greatest achievement.",,,

Ricco,2002-09-26,"Ricco is the last film of Swiss-American director Mike Wildbolz, who died shortly before its release at age 55. Strangely enough, the subject of Wildbolz's documentary also died relatively young, the painter Erich ""Ricco"" Wassmer (1915-1972). Perhaps because it was prophetic, or because Wildbolz sensed his fate and truly identified with Ricco, the life of the artist is related with a captivating poignancy, from his privileged but troubled childhood in Germany, to his artistic triumphs in Bern, to his career-wrecking imprisonment on the charge of immorality, ending with his life-draining illness in France. Wildbolz portrays Ricco as a victim throughout, a man misunderstood by bourgeois society and despised for his pursuit of exotic experiences (which, by the way, included an obsession with naked boys).",,,

Project Blue Book Exposed,2020-05-05,"Project Blue Book was the catalyst to the modern day UFO cover-up that still exists today.

Perhaps there are secret factions that have indeed communicated with alien entities and have received technology from them. But from the outside looking in, it appears nothing has changed as the UFOs continue to violate our airspace with impunity; and as before, military factions are powerless against the unknown invaders.",,Documentary,

Animal Antics,2021-10-15,"""Animal Antics"" is an absurdist take on the effects of the Anthropocene, from the perspective of a woman and her talking dog Whoopsie on a trip to the zoo.

A hybrid of Desmond Morris, Johnny Morris and Chris Morris, Goddard's film is a surreal, black-comic tour de force in which the anthropomorphic antics of man’s best friend offer up a deathly accurate mirror of mankind's very worst traits.",A story about absence.,Comedy,

The films became a meditation on art and craft, as well as on the dialectic of mind and body, concept and actual work."" -Katy Martin.",,,

In 1517, power was in the hands of the few, thought was controlled by the chosen, and common people lived lives without hope. On October 31 of that year, a penniless monk named Martin Luther sparked the revolution that would change everything.  He had no army. In fact, he preached nonviolence so powerfully that — 400 years later — Michael King would change his name to Martin Luther King to show solidarity with the original movement.  This movement, the Protestant Reformation, changed Western culture at its core, sparking the drive toward individualism, freedom of religion, women's rights, separation of church and state, and even free public education.

When the pioneers came north after the end of the last ice age, settled by the sea and loch shores and along the riverbanks, they began the continuous history of Scotland. The lost sub-continent of Doggerland, now submerged beneath the waves of the North Sea, is a key theme, bringing many of our ancestors from the east.

""I know I lied to get ahead,"" he admits at one point. ""I've made up so many different alphabets just to get ahead in my field."" The director is fancier now, but the fear nags that he might be ""repeating"" himself ""like a dumb soldier ova and ova and ova and ova.""

While the gentry of the 18th Century looked to the stars for the answer, an English clockmaker, John Harrison, toiled for decades to solve the problem. His elegant solution made him an unlikely hero and remains the basis for the most modern forms of navigation in the world today.

He turned out to be the most flamboyant of a ring of privileged Cambridge students who had secretly joined the Communists in the 1930s, disgusted by their own government's policy of appeasing Hitler.

This could symbolize the passing of time and the realization that life is transient. The persona mentions someone who was watching the cherry blossoms with regret, suggesting that they were aware of the beauty and brevity of the moment. The chorus, ""Everybody finds love, In the end,"" could imply that despite the fleeting nature of relationships, love ultimately prevails. It suggests that despite the impermanence of romantic connections, everyone will find love in the end. This can be seen as an optimistic message about the resilience of love. Overall, ""Sakura Nagashi"" conveys the delicate and transient nature of life and love, urging listeners to cherish moments, express their emotions, and embrace love despite its impermanence.  —SongTell",,,

The Great War in Colour,2014-06-01,"Even though the technology existed to produce colour at the time, most of the surviving films and photographs of the Great War were shot in black and white.

On the other side of the world, another form of domination holds sway. A Great Way of Life is a horror film as relevant today as it was in 1970. [Overview courtesy of William E. Jones]",,,

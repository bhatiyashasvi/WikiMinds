Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL?,2009-10-20,en,Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL?,"In 1983 the upstart United States Football League (USFL) had the audacity to challenge the almighty NFL.

But with success came expansion and new owners, including a certain high profile and impatient real estate baron whose vision was at odds with the league’s founders. Soon, the USFL was reduced to waging a desperate anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL, which yielded an ironic verdict that effectively forced the league out of business. Now, almost a quarter of a century later, Academy Award-nominated and Peabody Award-winning director Mike Tollin, himself once a chronicler of the league, will showcase the remarkable influence of those three years on football history and attempt to answer the question, “Who Killed the USFL?”","For three glorious years, football was 365",Documentary,english,"sports, american football, sports documentary, sports league"
